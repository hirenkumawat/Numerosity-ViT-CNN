### Abstract

Numerosity, the ability to visually discriminate quantities of items, has long been a subject of inquiry in cognitive science. Prior works using CNNs seem to pick up on numerosity without an explicit training objective geared towards the concept itself. Newer models like vision transformers (ViTs) have shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance and stronger understandings of long-range dependencies; experimenting with ViTsâ€™ ability to comprehend numerosity is a promising area of research and can provide insight as to whether the human-alignment observed with CNNs is architecture specific. In this work, we use a pre-trained ViT and experiment with its ability to understand various types of numerosity stimuli. We show competitive results against VGG-19 models and even outperform in certain tests. We further analyze our results using attention maps and activation maps.
